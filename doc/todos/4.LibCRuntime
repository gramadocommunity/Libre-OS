LibC Runtime TODO List:


Updated 5/25/2019



1. Standard C Implementation :
  Alot of functions have yet to be implemented, either due to lack of kernel
necessities , or knowledge of implementing them.

2. POSIX C Implementation :
  The library should be posix compliant for easier portability (userspace
programs)
